# Virtual Machines

## Overview

Sometimes I need a virtual machine (VM) to experiment with things in order to avoid messing up with my host machine. This folder allows me to provision a VM of the specified operating system (OS) with the wanted environment.

I use `vagrant` to create the VMs and `ansible` to set up the environment inside the VMs.
