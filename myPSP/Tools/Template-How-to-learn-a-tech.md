## Introduction

This document describes what aspects of a technology I need to pay attention to when learning it.

## Aspects

When learning a technology, pay attention to the aspects below:

- What **problems** does it try to solve?
- In a historical context, how does it evolve to what it is now?
- What does it **do** and **not do**?
- What is its **domain model**? In other words:
  - What components does this technology comprise of?
  - How those components work with each other?
- What is the domain model of its target problem?
  -Understanding its problem domain may also help understand the technology itself.
