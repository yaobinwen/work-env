## Plan & Estimate

(List the estimated work.)

Tech:
- JavaScript

Assumptions:
- Assumption 1
- Assumption 2

Work:
- [ ] W1: Product

  - [ ] W2.1: System test
  - [ ] W2.2: Unit tests

## Actual Execution

In this section:
- We only track the work that is **newly added**.
- We leave the boxes unchecked in the `Plan & Estimate` section to indicate the work that is not done.

Work:
- [ ] W1: Product
- [ ] W2: Tests
- [ ] W4: Unplanned: This tracks the tasks I didn't foresee when I estimated the work.
  - We don't use "W3" because it is for going through the checklist.

## Deviation Analysis

In this section:
- We list the tasks that are either **seriously** under- or over-estimated.
- We analyze why the estimates were so wrong.

Being "seriously" is subjective but if a task takes 50% less or more of the estimated time, I consider it "seriously under- or over-estimated". For example, a task is estimated to take 1 hour, but eventually it takes 30 minutes (or less) or 2 hours (or more).
