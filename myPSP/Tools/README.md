# Tools

## Overview

This document contains the tools that can help enhance the software engineering practices.

## List

- [Checklist.md](Checklist.md): My own checklist to make sure I don't repeat the same mistakes.
- [Codecov.io](https://codecov.io/): Code coverage done right. Enhancing development workflows and improving code quality.
- [Template-How-to-learn-a-tech.md](Template-How-to-learn-a-tech.md): The aspects to pay attention to when learning a technology.
- [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/): An issue tracking system.

## YouTrack

If a task is too big or too vague, I create one task as the overal tracker and divide it into smaller ones as `sub-tasks`. I don't need to create all the sub-tasks in one sitting. In fact, it's natural that you keep adding new sub-tasks as you understand the parent task better.

But each sub-task should be clearly defined. Although it's possible that you find new uncertainties after you start to work on the task, when you define it, you should be able to develop a clear roadmap for it to your best knowledge.

Sometimes, after you finish a sub-task, you are not clear what to do next. You need to step back to look at the information you already have so far to figure out the next step. This kind of work doesn't belong to any sub-task. Therefore, I count it as part of the parent task and track my time there. The time tracking should eventually look like this:

- Parent task (Estimated: 3h10m; Spent: 5h)
  - Sub-task 1 (Estimated: 1h; Spent: 1h30m)
  - Sub-task 2 (Estimated: 40m; Spent: 20m)
  - Sub-task 3 (Estimated: 1h30m; Spent: 2h)

In the example above, the total spent time (5h) is more than the sum of all the sub-tasks' spent time (3h50m). This is because of the additional time spent on thinking about what to do next.

## Reminder

It's very easy to forget planning in the morning, task scope management, or the reflection at the end of the day. Creating reminders is useful:

- Morning planning reminder: Set at the some time before you arrive at the office.
- Scope control reminder: Set as a periodical one during the day, such as once per hour, so you can manage the scope before you go too far.
- Evening reflection reminder: Set at the time before you leave the office.
