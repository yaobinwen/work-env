# myPSP Script

## Overview

- Version: 2018-07-12
- Purposes:
  - Find as many bugs as possible before the delivery of my task.
    - **Measurement**: The number of bugs that are found after I publish my work.
  - Manage the scope of my tasks so they don't get expanded erratically.
    - The further purpose is to increase my throughput so I can get as many tasks done as possible.
    - **Measurement**: The number of my Pull Requests that are ready for review and merge in one week. I don't use the number of _merged_ Pull Requests because the review depends on others availability. If I use the merged number, that also measures the others' throughput, not just mine.
