## Problem Description

On July 26th, 2018, I thought about how to plan a task that doesn't have a clear roadmap. Today, I needed to plan such tasks again, so it is better I formally define the planning process for later reference.

## Action Items

- [x] Define what a "probe" task is.
- [x] Add planning process of probe tasks.
- [ ] Build this action into daily work routine in order to close this PEP.
