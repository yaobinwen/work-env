## Problem Description

I find myself to easily drift from the original task intention and work on things that are out of the task scope, sometimes for days. This is because I don't define the task scope or develop a roadmap of how I plan to finish the task. I just write down vague description of it and start to work. Because of the lacking of the roadmap, I can easily get lost in the task details and head to the wrong direction.

In fact, if I can't develop a roadmap for the given task, that means there are uncertainties which I may need to work on as a separate task. In other words, the tasks with too much uncertainty is not ready to be started with. Some investigation is needed first.

## Action Items

- [x] Add roadmap development to the planning phase.
- [ ] Build this action into daily work routine in order to close this PEP.
