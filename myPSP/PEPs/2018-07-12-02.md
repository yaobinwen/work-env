## Overview

| Item | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| Index | 2018-07-12-02 |
| Purpose | Add `Reflection` to the work process.  |
| Status | Closed |

## Problem Description

Although recording the data is important, reviewing the data is more important because this is when the reflection happens. If I keep recording the data without reviewing them, the data are not helping me and hence meaningless.

## Action Items

- [x] Add `Reflection` to the work process.
- [x] Build this action into daily work routine in order to close this PEP.
