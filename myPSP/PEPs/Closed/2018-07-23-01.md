## Problem Description

Although I have defined the output of each process step, I haven't defined the activities for each step. The lack of definition may compromise the consistency that I may not always do the work in the same way from day to day. But consistency is important for habit creation as well as data collection.

## Action Items

- [x] Add activities I need to do for each process step.
