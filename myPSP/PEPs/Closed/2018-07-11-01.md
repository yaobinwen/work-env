## Problem Description

The PSP `2018-07-11` does not define the purpose of the data collection. Therefore, even if I can collect a lot of time consumption data, I don't know how to use the collected data to improve my work quality, nor do I know whether I am collecting the right data.

## Action Items

- [x] Define the purposes of my personal software process.
- [x] Define the measurement of success to the purposes.
