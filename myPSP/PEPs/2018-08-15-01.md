## Problem Description

My colleagues send meeting invitations through Google Calendar. Sometimes the invitations are sent days ahead the actual time of events, so if I don't check my Calendar, I may get unexpected reminders in the middle of the day.

## Action Items

- [x] Add Calendar as task source for planning.
