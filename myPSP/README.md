## Introduction

This repository, `myPSP`, is my own implementation of [Personal Software Process (PSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process). PSP is a self-improvement software process for software engineers to improve the work quality _precisely_, _quantitatively_, and _continuously_.

In other words, PSP is the "version control system" of one's work skills to show how they evolve. It also convinces others, tangibly and not verbally, that one makes actual effort to become better at work.

This repository is a (yet-another) attempt to equip myself with this methodology that I believe can help me work increasingly better. I want to become an outstanding software engineer. I don't want to die silently as a mediocrity.

The _"yet another"_ modifier tells that I had tried several times before but didn't make through it eventually. I reflected on what I did and realized the three keys to successful execution of the practice:

- **Incrementalism:** PSP practice requires a lot of **discipline**. To some extent, I think I need to train myself to work like a "robot" which can follow the defined process under any circumstances. Unfortunately, discipline is something people are generally in lack of because it counters the human nature of freedom and laziness. This is why incrementalism is helpful: changing a lot of behaviors all in once is a lot harder than changing one of them a time. I need to keep reminding me of not rushing but making small and firm progress.
- **Being practical:** When I tried to do PSP previously, I set up a process that was very different than what I was actually doing daily. Although that reflected my eagerness to change my situation, that essentially broke the rule of _incrementalism_: the gap between the ideal and the reality was too large to leap over in one step.
- **Stick in tough situation:** When I didn't experience a lot of schedule pressure at work, I could kind of follow the PSP practice. However, when I started to face schedule pressure, I threw it away immidiately: no planning, no estimating, just hacking. Again, _incrementailism_ may help because I don't need to perform too differently than what I can already perform as a routine. Then, as long as I could have some reminder mechanism, it should be easier to still follow the practice under pressure.

## Artifacts

The folder `myPSP` has content as follows:

- `Scripts`: This folder has the definition of my personal process which I am currently using.
- `Reflections`: This folder has the reflections upon the execution of my personal process.
- `PEPs`: This folder has the Process Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) which I plan to build into my work habit.
- `Tools`: This folder has the tools that can help enhance the software engineering practices.

The flowchart of these artifacts is shown as follows:

## Scientific Method

The **Scientific Method** is a structured process to explore uncharted territory of science. The fields of computer science and engineering can apply it, too.

The Scientific Method may not be useful if you already know what you want to build generally, but is useful when you are researching you have no idea of. This method gives you a clear process to follow and to verify what works and does not work for you. The key point is: when you are down into the [rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_hole), don't go further and further off track. Instead, always limit the scope of current work, review the progress periodically to decide if you should stop or move on.
