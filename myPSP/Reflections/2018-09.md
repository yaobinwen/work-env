## 2018/09/10 (Monday)

I forgot to log the daily reflection for the past three work days, from Sept. 5th (Wednesday) to 7th (Friday). Part of the reason was I was busy with something else at the time I was supposed to log the reflection; it was also because I didn't have a way to remind me of this again so I just forgot to do that if I didn't do it in the first place.

This is also a good example to show how easy a good work style can deteriorate quickly if not well maintained.
