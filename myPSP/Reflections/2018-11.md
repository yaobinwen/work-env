## 2018/11/01 (Thursday)

I need to figure out a way to manage the accumulated knowledge while I'm working on a task. At the beginning, I used my private work git repository; later I switched to use `YouTrack`.

The way you "manage the knowledge" on `YouTrack` is to keep appending comments to the task thread. As a result, the knowledge is spreaded into many comments and hard to be referred to or reorganized. The number of comments may quickly go up if you just want to write down a one-liner thought and come back to organize them later. But `YouTrack` provides you the built-in functions to track the status and consumed time, which is a really good feature.

Instead, if you use a private work git repository and a simple markdown document, you can easily put down the random thoughts and reorganize them later. But then you won't get benefit from the work tracking feature and have to calculate that manually.

I haven been struggling to figure out the best way for me to record how I do my tasks. Eventually, I give up `YouTrack` and come back to writing prose about my tasks, and I seem to find it pretty neat.

What I'm doing is this: When I start to work on a task, I create a Markdown file to record everything I will do, am doing, and did. This would be an intensive document for my work that I can review to see what I was doing and what attempts I made to fix the issues.

The idea behind is to record my flow of thoughts. If I don't, they will just be gone at the end of the task. Recording the flow of thoughts will help me review the thought process and figure out if there can be a better way of doing the similar tasks.

It's hard to keep up with the good work habbits and I have kind of screwed them up again, but I'm trying to get them back.

The best way of keeping up with the most recent development of technology is to subscribe news list so the important events will be pushed to your inbox. You don't have to track them manually.
